- **Data Flow**: Login ‚Üí Store in session ‚Üí Include in every authenticated API call

### **Event ID**
- **Purpose**: Context for all operations - defines which event/venue is being monitored
- **Frontend Usage**: Set once during session, added to most API calls as query parameter
- **Where Used**: Map data, alerts, reports, AI insights, all event-specific operations
- **Data Flow**: Set during login ‚Üí Persist throughout session ‚Üí Filter all data

### **Zone ID**
- **Purpose**: Specific area within event for targeted operations and filtering
- **Frontend Usage**: Dynamic selection based on user interactions with map
